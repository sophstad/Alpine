# Alpine
Alpine is a theme for Tumblr. Check out a live demo [here](http://hypertexts.tumblr.com). Alpine looks something like this:

## Content Types
### Photosets
Responsive photosets had been the bane of my existence since day one. For most of Alpine's existence, I was using a hacky method that simply took the raw images from the photosets and arranged them using floats and stuff. However, it wouldn't allow you to click on the photos to enlarge, and was a bit slow. But now, thanks to the new `{Photoset}` tag, they're responsive! (Previously, photosets looked like `{Photoset-700}` with a fixed dimension.) This is exciting stuff!

### Video
I've worked hard to make video as close to responsive as possible. This works better for certain video aspects than others, but it works.

## Customization
Alpine allows for some visual customization, allowing users to set background images and accent colors.

## CSS
Tumblr CSS goes at the beginning of the file (or inline). It sucks.

## Workflow
This is the worst part about developing Tumblr themes, in my opinion. [Tumblargh](https://github.com/jasonwebster/tumblargh) wasn't useful for me. I'm going to try some of the strategies outlined [here](http://bentoncreation.com/post/96678111370/a-tumblr-theme-development-workflow) next. Until then, it's not fun.
